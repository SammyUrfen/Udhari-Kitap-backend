# Phase 6: Activity Feed / Notifications - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 6 adds a comprehensive activity feed and notification system that automatically tracks all user actions (expenses created, payments made) and displays them in a chronological feed.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. **Activity Model** (`src/models/activity.js`)

**Schema Fields:**
- `type`: Activity type (EXPENSE_CREATED, TRANSACTION_CREATED, etc.)
- `actor`: User who performed the action
- `targets`: Array of users who should see this activity
- `payload`: Activity-specific data (title, description, amount, references)
- `isReadBy`: Array of users who have marked as read
- `createdAt`: Timestamp

**Key Features:**
- Compound indexes for efficient querying
- Instance methods: `isReadByUser()`, `markAsReadBy()`, `markAsUnreadBy()`, `toSafeObject()`
- Static methods: `getForUser()`, `countUnreadForUser()`

**Activity Types:**
- `EXPENSE_CREATED`: When a new expense is created
- `TRANSACTION_CREATED`: When a payment/settlement is made
- `EXPENSE_UPDATED`: When an expense is modified (prepared for future)
- `EXPENSE_DELETED`: When an expense is deleted (prepared for future)
- `USER_ADDED`: When a user is added to an expense (prepared for future)

### 2. **Activity Service** (`src/services/activityService.js`)

**Functions:**
- `createExpenseActivity()`: Creates activity when expense is created
- `createTransactionActivity()`: Creates activity when transaction is made
- `createExpenseUpdateActivity()`: For future expense edits
- `createExpenseDeleteActivity()`: For future expense deletions
- `getActivityFeed()`: Fetch activities with filtering and pagination
- `markActivityAsRead()`: Mark individual activity as read
- `markAllAsRead()`: Mark all activities as read for a user

**Smart Features:**
- Non-blocking activity creation (uses `.catch()` to prevent main flow disruption)
- Automatic target extraction (all participants in expense/transaction)
- Rich payload with human-readable descriptions
- Error handling that doesn't break main operations

### 3. **Activity Controller** (`src/controllers/activityController.js`)

**Endpoints:**
- `getActivities()`: GET /api/activities
  - Supports pagination (page, limit)
  - Filter by activity type
  - Filter by read/unread status
  - Returns unread count

- `markAsRead()`: PATCH /api/activities/:id/read
  - Mark specific activity as read
  - Authorization check (only targets can mark)

- `markAllAsRead()`: PATCH /api/activities/read-all
  - Mark all user's activities as read

- `getUnreadCount()`: GET /api/activities/unread-count
  - Quick endpoint to get notification badge count

### 4. **Activity Routes** (`src/routes/activities.js`)

All routes require authentication. Proper route ordering to avoid conflicts:
1. `/unread-count` - Must come before `/:id`
2. `/` - Main activity feed
3. `/read-all` - Mark all as read
4. `/:id/read` - Mark specific as read

### 5. **Integration with Existing Controllers**

**Expense Controller:**
- Added `createExpenseActivity()` call after expense creation
- Non-blocking async call with error handling

**Transaction Controller:**
- Added `createTransactionActivity()` call after transaction creation
- Non-blocking async call with error handling

}
```

## Test Results âœ…

All features tested successfully:

### âœ… Activity Creation
- **Expense Creation**: Activity automatically created with all participants as targets
- **Transaction Creation**: Activity automatically created with sender and receiver as targets
- **Proper Targeting**: Only relevant users see activities

### âœ… Activity Feed
- **Alice's Feed**: Shows both expense (she created) and transaction (she received)
- **Bob's Feed**: Shows both expense (participant) and transaction (he sent)
- **Charlie's Feed**: Shows only expense (participant), NOT the transaction
- **Correct Targeting**: Each user sees only activities relevant to them

### âœ… Read/Unread Status
- **Initial State**: All activities start as unread (`isRead: false`)
- **Mark as Read**: Successfully marks individual activity as read
- **Unread Count**: Correctly decreases when activities marked as read
- **Mark All as Read**: Successfully marks all activities as read at once
- **Per-User Tracking**: Alice marking as read doesn't affect Bob's read status

### âœ… Filtering
- **Type Filter**: `?type=EXPENSE_CREATED` shows only expense activities
- **Unread Filter**: `?unreadOnly=true` shows only unread activities
- **Combination**: Filters work together correctly

### âœ… Pagination
- Default limit: 20 items per page
- Proper pagination metadata returned
- Total count accurate

### âœ… Validation & Authorization
- Invalid activity ID format rejected
- Non-existent activity returns 404
- Users can only mark activities they're targets of

## Code Quality Highlights

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns (model, service, controller, routes)
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Extensible activity type system (easy to add new types)
- Service layer handles all business logic

### Readability
- Descriptive activity payload (title, description)
- Human-readable messages ("Alice paid â‚¹150 for 'Coffee Shop'")
- Clear method names (`markAsReadBy`, `getForUser`)
- Well-structured schema with comments

### Performance
- Compound indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient queries using MongoDB operators
- Pagination prevents large data transfers
- Non-blocking activity creation

### Error Handling
- Activity creation failures don't break main flow
- Proper error messages for validation failures
- Authorization checks prevent unauthorized access
- Graceful degradation (activity creation is optional)

## How It Works: Complete Flow

### Scenario: Alice creates an expense

1. **User Action**: Alice creates expense via POST /api/expenses
2. **Expense Created**: Expense saved to database
3. **Activity Creation Triggered**: 
   ```javascript
   createExpenseActivity(expense, req.user._id).catch(err => {
     console.error('Failed to create expense activity:', err);
   });
   ```
4. **Activity Service**:
   - Extracts all participants (Alice, Bob, Charlie)
   - Creates activity with type `EXPENSE_CREATED`
   - Sets Alice as actor
   - Sets all participants as targets
   - Builds payload with title, description, amount
5. **Activity Saved**: Activity document saved to database
6. **Users See It**: 
   - Alice sees: "Alice paid â‚¹150 for 'Coffee Shop'" (isRead: false)
   - Bob sees: Same activity (isRead: false)
   - Charlie sees: Same activity (isRead: false)

### Scenario: Bob marks activity as read

1. **User Action**: Bob calls PATCH /api/activities/:id/read
2. **Authorization Check**: Verify Bob is in activity's targets
3. **Mark as Read**: Add Bob's ID to `isReadBy` array
4. **Response**: Activity returned with `isRead: true` (for Bob)
5. **Other Users Unaffected**: Alice and Charlie still see it as unread

## Database Structure

### Activity Document Example
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  type: "EXPENSE_CREATED",
  actor: ObjectId("alice_id"),
  targets: [
    ObjectId("alice_id"),
    ObjectId("bob_id"),
    ObjectId("charlie_id")
  ],
  payload: {
    expenseId: ObjectId("expense_id"),
    title: "New expense: Coffee Shop",
    description: "Alice paid â‚¹150 for 'Coffee Shop'",
    amount: 15000,
    metadata: {
      participantCount: 3,
      splitMethod: "equal"
    }
  },
  isReadBy: [
    ObjectId("alice_id"),
    ObjectId("bob_id")
  ],
  createdAt: ISODate("2025-10-22T09:15:40.615Z")
}
```

### Indexes
- `{ type: 1, createdAt: -1 }` - Type-based queries
- `{ targets: 1, createdAt: -1 }` - User-specific feeds
- `{ actor: 1, createdAt: -1 }` - Actor-based queries

## Phase 6 Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your activity feed and notification system is fully functional and production-ready!

**Features Working:**
- âœ… Automatic activity creation for expenses and transactions
- âœ… Real-time activity feeds with filtering and pagination
- âœ… Read/unread status tracking per user
- âœ… Unread notification counts
- âœ… Mark individual or all activities as read
