EXPENSE_ID=$(echo $EXPENSE_RESPONSE | jq -r '.expense.id')

# 6. Bob checks notifications
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/activities \

# 7. Alice edits expense (realized bill was ₹300)
curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/expenses/$EXPENSE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"amount\":300,\"participants\":[{\"user\":\"$ALICE_ID\",\"share\":150},{\"user\":\"$BOB_ID\",\"share\":150}]}"

# 8. Bob checks updated notification

# 10. Verify balance is now ₹0
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/friends \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN"

# 11. Alice can now delete Bob from friends
FRIEND_ID=$(curl -s -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/friends \
